To my dear:
You has been 60 days in my womb. We are very happy for you coming. We believe you are a gift from god. So we have a little bit worry that we can’t take care of you well. At your first 3 months, I am always worrying that you may get sick. Many of my friends’ baby stop to grow at this period. 

If you feel uncomfortable, you can’t tell us. I hope you are healthy in my womb. Your dad is very kind to me. He expects that you are a boy. Then you can play game with him. However he will be very happy as well if you are a princess, because the girl always love her dad more than her mom.
Anyway when your dad graduate, get a good job, and then you are coming, we will be a sweet family.
